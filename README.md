# Genetic Clustering Algorithms to Increase Fairness in Collegiate Athletics

I am part of a team working on a paper on this topic, based on
work we did in 2017-2018.  This repository contains the data and
algorithms for part of our work, and will be referenced in the
paper.

### Resources available now:

 * [A PDF rendering of the Jupyter notebook in this folder](ncaa_region_optimizer.pdf)
 * A link to MyBinder.org where you can run the notebook interactively: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nathancarter/clustering-for-ncaa/master?urlpath=lab/tree/ncaa_region_optimizer.ipynb)

### Resources still to come:

 * A preprint of the paper
